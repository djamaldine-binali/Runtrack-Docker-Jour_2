### Runtrack Docker Jour 02 : Job 04

To setup our Docker project for a web application, we need those files in our vscode project folder :

We are going to host a "tic-tac-toe" game using Docker. 

To do so we need to create a Docker file that will define how our images interact with our other files and the container's volume (we will see about that a bit later). 

```sh
FROM <base_image>
```
Defines the base image for the Docker containers. 

```sh
RUN <your_command>
```
This command lets use execute commands durign the image building process, it does not run commands when the container starts.

```sh
COPY <file_path> <path_to_copy_into>
```

It's used to copy files from one directory to another, useful when we want to store data of any sort. 

```sh
chmod <permissions>
```

Assigns access and permission. It can be used for various reasons, from giving files some persmissions, to user acces to other files.

```sh
EXPOSE <port>
```

Declares which port the container will listen to at runtime though you still need to use the `-p` command when running your container since it doens't actually open the port or make it accessible from outside said container. 

```sh
CMD <your_command>
```

A start command, sets default command to run when the container starts

In our file we proceeded as follows with these commands :

```sh
FROM php:7.4-fpm
```

We set the base image to PHP-FPM. PHP-FPM executes PHP script in the background and sends it to web servers like nginx.

```sh
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
```

`apt-get update` updates the systems  `apt-get install -y nginx` installe nginx pour servir les fichiers et traiter les requ√®tes.

```sh
RUN echo <nginx_setup>
```

* Listens to port 80 `listens 80;`
* Defines root for website `root /usr/share/nginx/html;`
* home page `index.html`
  
Request management :
* Tries to load requested file, if it can't displays error 404 message `try _files $uri/=404`
* Nginx can't treat php files so it sends the php requests to PHP-FPM that will execute them and return them to nginx to display them on the web page `fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;`
* Copy `index.html`, `save.php` and `results.json` towards /usr/share/nginx/html which is the website's root :
  How it works
  * `index.html` is in /usr/share/nginx/html since it's the main page.
  * `save.php` and `results.json` are stored in `/usr/share/nginx/html/results/`
* Acces permissions : `RUN chmod -R 777 /usr/share/nginx/html/results/` -> Gives full access (reading, writing, execute)
